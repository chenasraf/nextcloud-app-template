# Nextcloud App Template

This is a starter template for a Nextcloud app, using Vue 3 with Vite as frontend.

It also has a convenient file generator for when you will be developing your app.

## How to use this template

At the top of the GitHub page for this repository, click "Use this template" to create a copy of
this repository.

Once you have it cloned on your machine:

1. Run `./rename-template.sh` to do a mass renaming of all the relevant files to match your app name
   and your user/full name. They will be asked as input when you run the script. This will also move
   the GitHub workflow files to the right place.
1. Run `make` - this will trigger the initial build, download all dependencies and make other
   preparations as necessary.
1. Start developing! Read the rest of the readme below for more information about what you can do.

## Makefile

There is a robust Makefile in the project which should give you everything you need in order to
develop &amp; release your app.

Below is a rundown of the different targets you can run:

| Command             | What it does                                                                                                                       | When to use it                        | Notes                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make`              | Alias for `make build`.                                                                                                            | Anytime; default target.              | Same as `make build`.                                                  |
| `make build`        | Installs PHP deps (if `composer.json` exists) and JS deps (if `package.json` or `js/package.json` exists), then runs the JS build. | First run; after pulling changes; CI. | Skips steps that don’t apply (no `composer.json` / no `package.json`). |
| `make composer`     | Installs Composer deps. If Composer isn’t installed, fetches a local `composer.phar`.                                              | When PHP deps changed.                | Skips if `vendor/` already exists.                                     |
| `make pnpm`         | `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` then run build. Uses root `package.json` if present, else `js/`.                                  | When JS deps or build changed.        | Requires `pnpm`.                                                       |
| `make clean`        | Removes `build/` artifacts.                                                                                                        | Before re-packaging; to start fresh.  | Keeps dependencies.                                                    |
| `make distclean`    | `clean` + removes `vendor/`, `node_modules/`, `js/vendor/`, `js/node_modules/`.                                                    | Nuke-from-orbit cleanup.              | You’ll need to re-install deps.                                        |
| `make dist`         | Runs `make source` and `make appstore`.                                                                                            | Release prep; CI packaging.           | Produces both tarballs.                                                |
| `make source`       | Builds a **source** tarball at `build/artifacts/source/<app>.tar.gz`.                                                              | Sharing source-only bundle.           | Excludes tests, logs, node_modules, etc.                               |
| `make appstore`     | Builds an **App Store–ready** tarball at `build/artifacts/appstore/<app>.tar.gz`.                                                  | Upload to Nextcloud App Store.        | Aggressively excludes dev/test files & dotfiles.                       |
| `make test`         | Runs PHP unit tests (`tests/phpunit.xml` and optional `tests/phpunit.integration.xml`).                                            | CI or local test run.                 | Ensures Composer deps first.                                           |
| `make lint`         | Lints JS (`pnpm lint`) and PHP (`composer run lint` via local `composer.phar` if needed).                                          | Pre-commit checks.                    | Requires corresponding scripts.                                        |
| `make php-cs-fixer` | Fixes **staged** PHP files with PHP-CS-Fixer (after `php -l`).                                                                     | Before committing PHP changes.        | Operates on files staged in Git.                                       |
| `make format`       | Formats JS (`pnpm format`) and PHP (`composer run cs:fix`).                                                                        | Enforce code style.                   | Requires those scripts in composer/package.json.                       |
| `make openapi`      | Generates OpenAPI JSON via composer script `openapi`.                                                                              | Refresh API docs.                     | Output: `build/openapi/openapi.json`.                                  |
| `make sign`         | Downloads the GitHub release tarball for the version in `version.txt` and prints a base64 SHA-512 signature.                       | Manual signing for App Store.         | Needs private key at `~/.nextcloud/certificates/<app>.key`.            |
| `make release`      | Uploads the signed release to the Nextcloud App Store.                                                                             | Final publish step.                   | Needs `NEXTCLOUD_API_TOKEN` env var; prompts if missing.               |

### Quick workflows

**Fresh setup / development**

```bash
pnpm --version   # ensure pnpm is installed
make build       # install PHP+JS deps and build
make test        # run PHP tests
make lint        # lint JS + PHP
```

**Package for release**

```bash
make dist        # builds both source + appstore tarballs
```

**Sign and publish to App Store**

```bash
# Ensure version.txt is set, and your key exists at ~/.nextcloud/certificates/<app>.key
make sign        # prints signature for the GitHub tarball
export NEXTCLOUD_API_TOKEN=...   # or let the target prompt you
make release
```

> Prerequisites: `make`, `curl`, `tar`, `pnpm`, and (optionally) `composer`. If Composer isn’t
> installed, the Makefile auto-downloads a local `composer.phar`.

## NPM (package.json)

Run with `pnpm <script>` (or `npm run <script>` / `yarn <script>` if you prefer).

| Script         | What it does                                                                         | When to use it                                                    | Notes                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`     | Runs `vite build --watch`.                                                           | Local dev where you want incremental rebuilds written to `dist/`. | This is a **watching build**, not a dev server. It continuously rebuilds on file changes. Pair it with Nextcloud serving the compiled assets. |
| `pnpm build`   | Type-checks with `vue-tsc -b` and then does a full `vite build`.                     | CI, release builds, or when you want a clean production bundle.   | `vue-tsc -b` runs TypeScript project references/build mode, catching TS errors beyond ESLint.                                                 |
| `pnpm lint`    | Lints the `src/` directory using ESLint.                                             | Quick checks before committing or in CI.                          | Respects your `.eslintrc*` config. No auto-fix.                                                                                               |
| `pnpm format`  | Auto-fixes ESLint issues in `src/` and then runs Prettier on `src/` and `README.md`. | Enforce consistent style automatically.                           | Safe to run often; keeps diffs clean.                                                                                                         |
| `pnpm prepare` | Runs `husky` installation hook.                                                      | After `pnpm install` (automatically).                             | Ensures Git hooks (like pre-commit linting) are installed.                                                                                    |
| `pnpm gen`     | Generates scaffolding for various templates (both PHP and TS)                        | Anytime you want to easily create new files from templates.       | See [below](#scaffolding)                                                                                                                     |

## Common workflows

**While developing (continuous build output):**

```bash
pnpm dev
# Edit files → Vite rebuilds to dist/ automatically.
```

**Before pushing a branch (runs automatically using commit hooks):**

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm build
```

**Fix style issues quickly:**

```bash
pnpm format
```

**Fresh clone:**

```bash
pnpm install
# husky installs via "prepare"
pnpm build
```

### Scaffolding

Generate boilerplate for common app pieces with:

```bash
pnpm gen <type> [name]
```

- **`name` is required** for every type **except** `migration`.
- Files are created from templates in `gen/<type>` and written to the configured output directory.
  Feel free to modify/remove any of these templates or add new ones.
- Generators never create subfolders (they write directly into the output path).

#### Available generators

| Type          | Purpose                                   | Output directory | Name required? | Template folder   | Notes                                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `component`   | Vue single-file component for reusable UI | `src/components` | ✅             | `gen/component`   | For user-facing building blocks.                  |
| `page`        | Vue page / route view                     | `src/pages`      | ✅             | `gen/page`        | Pair with your router.                            |
| `api`         | PHP controller (API endpoint)             | `lib/Controller` | ✅             | `gen/api`         | PSR-4 namespace: `OCA\<App>\Controller`.          |
| `service`     | PHP service class                         | `lib/Service`    | ✅             | `gen/service`     | Business logic; DI-friendly.                      |
| `util`        | PHP utility/helper                        | `lib/Util`       | ✅             | `gen/util`        | Pure helpers / small utilities.                   |
| `model`       | PHP DB model / entity                     | `lib/Db`         | ✅             | `gen/model`       | Pair with migrations.                             |
| `command`     | Nextcloud OCC console command             | `lib/Command`    | ✅             | `gen/command`     | Shows up in `occ`.                                |
| `task-queued` | Queued background job                     | `lib/Cron`       | ✅             | `gen/task-queued` | Extend queued job base.                           |
| `task-timed`  | Timed background job (cron)               | `lib/Cron`       | ✅             | `gen/task-timed`  | Scheduled execution.                              |
| `migration`   | Database migration                        | `lib/Migration`  | ❌             | `gen/migration`   | Auto-numbers version; injects `version` and `dt`. |

##### How migrations are numbered

The scaffolder looks at `lib/Migration`, finds the latest `VersionNNNN...` file, and **increments**
it for you. It also injects:

- `version` — the next numeric version
- `dt` — a timestamp like `YYYYMMDDHHmmss` (via `date-fns`)

You don’t pass a name for migrations.

#### Examples

Create a Vue component:

```bash
pnpm gen component UserListItem
# → src/components/UserListItem.vue
```

Create a Vue page:

```bash
pnpm gen page Settings
# → src/pages/Settings.vue
```

Create an API controller:

```bash
pnpm gen api Users
# → lib/Controller/UsersController.php
```

Create a service:

```bash
pnpm gen service MyService
# → lib/Service/MyService.php
```

Create a queued job:

```bash
pnpm gen task-queued UpdateUsers
# → lib/Cron/UpdateUsers.php
```

Create a migration (no name):

```bash
pnpm gen migration
# → lib/Migration/Version{NEXT}.php   (with injected {version} and {dt})
```

#### Tips & gotchas

- **Router pages:** After `pnpm gen page <Name>`, add the route in your router
  (`src/router/index.ts`) and import the file.
- **Cron vs queued:** Use `task-timed` for scheduled runs, `task-queued` for background work
  enqueued by events or controllers.

## GitHub Workflows

Here’s a drop-in **GitHub Workflows** section for your README. It explains each workflow, what
triggers it, what it does, any required secrets, and how they’re enabled by your
`rename-template.sh` script.

---

## GitHub Workflows

In the template, all workflows live under **`.github/workflows.template/`** so they don’t run on the
template repo itself.

When you create a new project from this template and run `./rename-template.sh`, the script **moves
them to `.github/workflows/`** so Actions start running automatically.

## Release Please (automated versioning & releases)

This template includes **[Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please)** to
automate changelogs, tags, and GitHub releases based on **Conventional Commits**. It also updates
your app version in **`appinfo/info.xml`** as part of the release process.

### How it works

1. **You merge PRs** that use Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`).
2. The **“Release”** workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) runs **Release Please**:

   - Generates or updates a **release PR** with a version bump and changelog.
   - When that release PR is merged, it **creates a Git tag and GitHub Release**.

3. The workflow then:

   - **Builds the App Store tarball** (`make && make appstore`).
   - **Uploads the artifact** to the GitHub Release.
   - Optionally **publishes** to the Nextcloud App Store (via `make release`).

4. As part of the release, the **app version in `appinfo/info.xml` is updated** automatically.

### Conventional Commits (what to write in your commits)

- `feat: add currency search` → minor bump
- `fix: handle empty payload` → patch bump
- `docs: update README`
- `chore: bump deps`
- `refactor: extract service`
- **Breaking change:** include `!` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer e.g. `feat!: drop PHP 8.0`, or add
  a footer:

  ```
  BREAKING CHANGE: dropped PHP 8.0 support
  ```

> This template also includes a **“Block unconventional commits”** workflow to help you keep commit
> messages compliant.

### Required secrets (for full release automation)

- **`RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN`** — GitHub token for the Release Please action.
- **`NEXTCLOUD_API_TOKEN`** — App Store API token (for the final publish step).
- **`NEXTCLOUD_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`** — Private key used to sign the app (PEM text or base64).

> If you’re just testing the flow, you can skip the App Store secrets; the GitHub release and
> artifact upload will still work.

### Typical release flow

1. Merge feature/fix PRs with Conventional Commits.
2. Release Please opens/updates a **“release-please” PR** (you’ll see proposed version + changelog).
3. **Merge the release PR.** This:

   - Tags the repo (e.g., `v1.2.0`)
   - Creates the **GitHub Release**
   - Triggers build & artifact upload
   - Calls `make release` to publish to the **Nextcloud App Store** (if secrets are set)

### Troubleshooting

- **No release PR appears** → Ensure the `Release` workflow is enabled (moved from
  `.github/workflows.template/` by `./rename-template.sh`) and `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` is set.
- **Version not updated in `appinfo/info.xml`** → Check the `Release` workflow logs; make sure the
  release PR included the XML bump (action handles this).
- **App Store publish fails** → Verify `NEXTCLOUD_API_TOKEN` and `NEXTCLOUD_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`, and
  that `version.txt` matches the intended release version.
- **Initial version is 1.0.0** → If you want to start from a custom version, change it in
  `version.txt` and in `.release-please-manifest.json`. The default is `0.0.0` which bumps the first
  release to `1.0.0` automatically. If you start from a version like `0.1.0`, the next release will
  not bump the major until a breaking change is introduced.
